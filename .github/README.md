# GitHub Community Health Files

This folder contains shared community and contribution resources for the Garden Almanac project.

## Contents

- **ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**

  - `bug_report.md` → Standardized template for reporting bugs.
  - `feature_request.md` → Template for suggesting new features.
  - `config.yml` → Configures how issue templates appear in GitHub’s _New Issue_ screen.

- **pull_request_template.md**
  Guides contributors when opening a PR (checklist, summary, related issues).

- **CONTRIBUTING.md**
  Explains how to contribute (branching model, commit messages, coding style).

- **FUNDING.md**
  Optional funding links (e.g., GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, Ko-fi).

## Notes

- These files are duplicated in both `almanac-client` and `almanac-server` repos for consistency.
- If you change one, please update the other to keep them in sync.
- In the future, we may consolidate into a monorepo where this folder will be shared.
